# Hackerspace-Dark-Pattern-Detector
Welcome to the Dark Patterns Project! This project aims to identify, and analyze dark patterns on e-commerce websites. Dark patterns are deceptive design practices that manipulate users into taking actions they may not have intended. The goal of this project is to raise awareness about these patterns and promote ethical design practices.
